## **Example Use Case 🍿**

### **Finance Dashboard Use Case**  
🔹 A finance manager needs to assess the **quarterly revenue** and **expenses**.  
🔹 The dashboard allows them to **filter by department** and **time period** to get a detailed breakdown of performance.  
🔹 The finance team can use trend analysis to predict future revenue and plan budget allocations accordingly.

### **Ola Analytics Use Case**  
🔹 An operations manager wants to optimize the performance of **drivers** in a specific region.  
🔹 The dashboard lets them filter by **region**, **ride completion rate**, and **driver ratings** to identify high-performing drivers.  
🔹 They can also use geospatial mapping to identify **hotspots** with high demand for rides, ensuring efficient resource allocation.
